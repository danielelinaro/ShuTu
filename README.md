## Neuron reconstruction software for bright-field images

ShuTu is a software platform for semi-automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology. It is designed for neurons stained following patch-clamp recording and biocytin filling/staining.
More details about installing and using the software can be found at http://personal.psu.edu/dzj2/ShuTu.

The codes contain two parts that can be built separately:

* PythonCodes: programs for automatic reconstruction
* ShuTu_gui: GUI program for interactive reconstruction
